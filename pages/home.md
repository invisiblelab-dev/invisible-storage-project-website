### Mission

### Team

The project aims to develop a **modular hybrid architecture** that combines the strengths of **blockchain technology** (for data integrity, security, and availability) with **traditional storage systems and cloud computing** (for performance and scalability). The key goals are:

- Solve limitations of current blockchain systems for storing large volumes of data.
- Ensure **ease of use, installation, and maintenance** by integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to automate system configuration and adapt to different needs.
- Promote **adoption of secure, decentralized, and efficient data storage solutions**, especially for sensitive or regulated data (e.g., in healthcare or public administration).

This solution seeks to bridge the gap between blockchain potential and practical, large-scale applications.
