The research outputs from Invisible Storage will be disseminated through top scientific venues and released as an open-source prototype. The prototype will provide the first building block not only to handle data in the healthcare sector, but also to offer state-of-the-art performance to high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure managers. The project will include software developers, senior researchers and students who are working on PhD and MSc thesis focused on the scope of the project.

This page will be updated during the project duration.
