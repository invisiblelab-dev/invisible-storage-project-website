- On the 26th of March, we had the first kick-off — in-person — meeting between [Invisible Lab](https://invisiblelab.dev) and [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) at University of Minho. The goal was to align objectives and map out the path for the *Invisible Storage* project that secured 1.2M€ in funding under the **Portugal 2030 program**.
    
    **The challenge** is storing and processing data without compromising performance, security and compliance — which will be one of the biggest challenges of the next decade.
    
    We are developing a large-scale distributed system to support massive data volumes—critical, for instance, for training AI models—while ensuring security, data protection and immutability. By the end of 2025, we aim to launch the first paid pilot programs with clients.
